### Notes
Some of the challenges that I encountered where that I was having a hard time with the MovieCell. The program was not allowing me to click on MovieCell. What I had to do was that I had to delete it, and then I re-added it again. 
Another problem that I was having was that my sizing options were different in the simulator than they were in the main storyboard. I just had to switch the phones to the most recent one (iPhone 11) and it worked!
