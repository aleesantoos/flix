### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I actually had a lot of problems when I was building this app. I am someone that tries to do it myself, and I get embarrased showing off my work when I mess up. The first problem that I had was getting the backdrop to work. It wasn't working but what I did to fix it was that I had to delete and readd the backdrop in order for it to work. Another problem that I encountered was that I was getting an error on my MovieGridCell, and I fixed it by changing UIView to UIImageView. The third problem that I encountered was that my Superhero section was crashing, and I ended up having to just change the iPhone from an iPhone 11 to an iPhone 8. I had a lot of complications but overall I am extremely happy with my outcome!

### Notes
Some of the challenges that I encountered where that I was having a hard time with the MovieCell. The program was not allowing me to click on MovieCell. What I had to do was that I had to delete it, and then I re-added it again. 
Another problem that I was having was that my sizing options were different in the simulator than they were in the main storyboard. I just had to switch the phones to the most recent one (iPhone 11) and it worked!
